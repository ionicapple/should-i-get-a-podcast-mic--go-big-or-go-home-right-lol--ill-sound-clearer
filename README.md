# should-i-get-a-podcast-mic--go-big-or-go-home-right-lol--ill-sound-clearer

rode -- apparently the best

* https://rode.com/en-us/products/wireless-pro - i dunno if i need a wireless one

* https://rode.com/en-us/products/nt-usb-mini -- ok maybe this, but i like the smaller one cuz where should i put this, maybe i wanna travel with a mic or record things in another room; i read in a review on best buy that the base of this mic is magnetic so if u accidentally place it on top of your laptop itll wipe out the hard drive ummm thats not good, maybe ill get this ... maybeee, its on my maybe list

i gotta watch some reviews on these two to figure out which one i want to get

im asking chatgpt about the ones im interested in, im trying to think of the bigger picture, could be useful also for zoom things, i remember at m s k someone had a podcast mic in their setup in a meeting once so why not
